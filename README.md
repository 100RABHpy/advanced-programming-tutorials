# advanced-programming-tutorials
Questions and Code for the tutorials I'll deliver for CSE201

Suggestions and pull requests are welcome!
If you feel something can be improved, you can help improve the code:
- Open up an issue about your concern by clicking on the issue tab above
- We'll have a discussion on the best way to go about it 
- Finally you can submit a pull request and we'll merge your code to the repo 

Why should do all of this? Is this graded?
- No it's not graded
- With hacktoberfest coming in, it's a pretty good oppurtunity to learn about open source
- These activities will help you concretize your Advanced Programming concepts as well

Thanks for reading.
